Timmy kicked his feet underneath the table as he took another giant bite of his Bratwurst.
Although his bite was giant, all he got was the brot that tasted like it was from Berlin.
Disappointed, he set down his sausage and scanned the open room of the Biergarten.
Boredom sat in so he speed around on the Autobahn in his Audi jamming out to Rammstein musik.
Along his drive he spotted Schloss in the distance.
Which made him feel warm and fuzzy inside and decide to stop and purchase a dirndel.
Timmy decided to keep driving on the Hauptstrasse with his copilot, Hund,to get a closer look. 
He parked along the drive and put on his lederhose, there seemed to be a festival going on!
